#Project 4: FEND @ Udacity
## Website Performance Optimization Project

*The Challenge:*
1. Optimize the critical rendering path on index.html to achieve a PageSpeed score of 90+.
2. Optimize the browser rendering on tea-party.html to ensure a consistent frame rate of 60fps when scrolling on this page.
3. Optimize the size slider on tea-party.html so that resizing the tea pots takes less than 5ms, as shown in the browser console.
4. Document the code in main.js to explain longer procedures.
5. Include a README file detailing all the steps to successfully run the application (huh? which application?), and outline the optimization preformed.

####Part 1: Score 90+ on PageSpeed Insights for index.html

####Part 2: Ensure Consistent Rate of 60fps for Scrolling Tea pots

####Part 3: Optimize the Size Slider

####Part 4: Document the Code in main.js

####Part 5: Include a README file
I have included a README file. :-)

####NOTES ABOUT THE Project
1. I should have started working on this more seriously before January 12th, 2016. I realize I am a week late in submitting my project.
2. I missed having my team, as this was the first project I did after the teams were disbanded. I admit, I didn't make it to every team meeting, but it was nice to have a smaller group to ask all those "stupid" questions, versus feeling like a total ignoramus in the broader discussion forums.
3. I wasted too much time worrying about how the site looked. It was hard to let go of aesthetics for this project, although I got better at the end (especially once the deadline passed).
4. The pizzas really bothered me, and I also wasted time switching over to the Alice in Wonderland theme. But it really helped me function better for the remaining duration of the project. Probably the pizzas aren't a problem for most students -- I happen to keep kosher, and the default pizzas were about as not kosher as it gets.
