#Project 4: FEND @ Udacity
## Website Performance Optimization Project

*The Challenge:*
1. Optimize the critical rendering path on index.html to achieve a PageSpeed score of 90+.
2. Optimize the browser rendering on tea-party.html to ensure a consistent frame rate of 60fps when scrolling on this page.
3. Optimize the size slider on tea-party.html so that resizing the tea pots takes less than 5ms, as shown in the browser console.
4. Document the code in main.js to explain longer procedures.
5. Include a README file detailing all the steps to successfully run the application (huh? which application?), and outline the optimization preformed.
